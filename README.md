# HRT-Temp-Sensing-Github
This project has made during my powertrain membership of the Hercules Racing Team in University of Kassel. The code snipped helps you to sense additional 60 temperature sensor values but only using arduino(normally not provide enough analog inputs).
Using Multiplexer this sensing process can be done. Please check the details in the code for further information
